# Vulnerability Management
Managing vulnerabilities means finding and fixing weaknesses before attackers do.

### Steps in Vulnerability Management
- Identify vulnerabilities (via scanning tools)
- Assess risk (How bad is it?)
- Prioritize fixes (based on severity)
- Remediate (patch or mitigate the issue)
- Verify fix (test again)

### Vulnerability Scanning vs Pen Testing
- Vulnerability Scanning: Automated tools scan systems for known issues. Example: Nessus, OpenVAS

- Penetration Testing: Ethical hackers simulate real attacks to find hidden weaknesses.

### Common Vulnerability Tools
- Nessus – Commercial vulnerability scanner
- Nmap – Network mapper for discovering devices/services
- Metasploit – Tool for penetration testing

### Patch Management
- The process of keeping software updated to fix security holes.
- Needs to be done regularly and carefully (test patches first!).
