# Threat Modeling
Threat modeling is the process of identifying, understanding, and preparing for possible attacks on a system.

### STRIDE Model
Each letter stands for a type of threat:
- S – Spoofing: Pretending to be someone else (fake login)
- T – Tampering: Altering data (modifying files)
- R – Repudiation: Denying actions (no audit trail)
- I – Information Disclosure: Leaking private data
- D – Denial of Service: Crashing or overloading a system
- E – Elevation of Privilege: Getting more access than allowed

### Attack Trees
- A diagram showing how an attacker might achieve a goal. 
- Helps break down complex threats into smaller steps.

### Threat Matrix
- A table matching assets (like customer data) with possible threats. 
- Helps prioritize which threats to fix first.
