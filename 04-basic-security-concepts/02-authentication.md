# Authentication
It ensures that a person is who they claim to be. The process of verifying identity before granting access. Example: Logging in with username and password.


### Types of Authentication
- **Something You Know**: Password, PIN
- **Something You Have**: OTP, ID card, phone
- **Something You Are**: Fingerprint, face scan

> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) uses two or more of the above for better security. Example: 2 Factor Authentication (2FA)

### Common Authentication Methods
- **Passwords**: Basic but often weak. Needs policies to stay secure.
- **Biometrics**: Uses body features (e.g., fingerprint), very secure but needs special hardware.
- **Tokens & OTPs**: One-time codes sent to your phone/email.
- **SSO (Single Sign-On)**: Login once to access multiple systems (e.g., Google login).
