# Security Policies 
Security policies are rules and procedures that protect an organization’s systems and data.

### Password Policy
- Rules for creating strong passwords:
    - Minimum length (e.g., 12 characters)
    - Must include uppercase, lowercase, number, and symbol
    - Should be changed regularly
    - Should not be reused

### Access Control Models
- **DAC (Discretionary Access Control)**: The owner controls access. Example: You decide who can view your document.

- **MAC (Mandatory Access Control)**: Admin sets fixed access rules. Example: Military systems where data is classified.

- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Access is based on job roles. Example: Only HR can access payroll files.

### Acceptable Use Policy
 Tells users what they can and can’t do with company resources (e.g., no personal use of work computers).

### Incident Response Policy
- Defines what to do in case of a cyberattack.
- Includes reporting, isolating affected systems, and fixing the issue.
