# Linux
Linux itself is a kernel, not a complete operating system but when people say "Linux", they mean a Linux-based operating system (a Linux distribution) and that is Linux kernel + software tools + system libraries. It's based on UNIX developed in the 1991 by Linus Torvalds.

### Why I use linux?
It's open-source, highly portable, and lightweight which makes it perfect for running in virtual machines. Personally, I enjoy exploring the nerdy side of technology, learning how things work behind the scenes is both fun and fascinating to me.
