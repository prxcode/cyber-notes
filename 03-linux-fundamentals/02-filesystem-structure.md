# Linux Filesystem Structure
Linux uses a hierarchical file system starting from the root directory.

### Key Directories
- `/`: Root of the file system.
- `/root`: Home directory of root admin user.
- `/etc`: Configuration files for the system.
- `/bin`: Essential system binaries, cmds like ls, cp are stored here.
- `/usr`: User installed software and libraries. 
- `/var`: Variable data like logs, mail, etc.
- `/home`: Personal directories of users.
- `/tmp`: Temporary files.
- `/dev`: Device files like hard drives, USB, etc are stored here.
