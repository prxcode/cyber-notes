### Phases of Incident Response (NIST Framework)
- Preparation – Policies, tools, training in place before an incident.
- Identification – Detecting potential incidents (via SIEM, alerts).
- Containment – Isolating affected systems to prevent spread.
- Eradication – Removing the root cause (e.g., malware, backdoors).
- Recovery – Restoring systems, services, and normal operations.
- Lessons Learned – Post-incident review to improve future response.

### Incident Response Runbooks
- Predefined step-by-step procedures for handling specific incident types (e.g., phishing, ransomware, DDoS).
- Promotes consistency and speeds up IR.
