# Networking Fundamentals

### Network
A collection of interconnected devices that can share data. These devices communicate using rules called protocols.

### Types of Network
- **LAN**: Local Area Network
- **WAN**: Wide Area Network
- **MAN**: Metropolitan Area Network
- **PAN**: Personal Area Network

### Network Topologies
- Bus: Single cable, one break = all down
- Star: All connect to central device(like switch)
- Mesh: Devices connect to multiple devices
- Hybrid: Mix of Topologies

### ISP and IP
Internet service provider is the one who provides individuals and organizations access to the internet and other related services (ex. Vodafone). Internet Protocol Address is basically address of that computer, address is required in networking and packet transfer. Every system has IP address (ex 01.234.567.89).
Here, 
- 01 = Country
- 234 = state
- 567 = City/ISP
- 89 = Device ID
IP range between (0-255).

### Variations of IP
- IPv4
    - Address size 32 bit number.
    - Address format dotted decimal(192.159.25.76).
    - Number of address around 4.7 billion address.
- IPv6
    - Address size 128 bit number.
    - Hexadecimal notation(`3ffe:f200:0234:ab00:0123:4567:8901:abcd`).
    - Number of address aound 370 trillion.
 
### Types of IP
- 1. Private IP
  - For LAN(for small network)
  - Private IP !---> Public IP
