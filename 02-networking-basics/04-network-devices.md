# Network Devices
- **Router**: Connects different networks; handles routing based on IP addresses.
- **Switch**: Forwards data based on MAC addresses within a LAN.
- **Hub**: Broadcasts data to all devices (less secure/efficient than switches).
- **Firewall**: Monitors and controls incoming/outgoing traffic using rules.
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes network traffic across multiple servers.
- **IDS/IPS**: Detects and prevents malicious activities.
  - IDS = Detect only
  - IPS = Detect + Block
