# FFirewall
A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming/outgoing traffic based on predetermined security rules.

### Types of Firewalls:
- Packet Filtering Firewall
    - Operates at Network Layer (Layer 3).
    - Filters traffic based on IP, port, protocol.

- Stateful Inspection Firewall
    - Tracks the state of active connections.
    - More secure than packet filtering.

- Application Layer Firewall
    - Works at Layer 7.
    - Inspects application-level data (e.g., HTTP).

- Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)
    - Includes DPI, IPS, antivirus, app awareness.

### Firewall Deployment:
- Perimeter firewall: At the network boundary.
- Internal firewall: Between departments or zones.
- Host-based firewall: On individual systems.

### Firewall Rules:
- Allow, Deny, or Drop traffic.
- Based on source/destination IP, port, protocol.

### Advantages:
- Prevents unauthorized access.
- Centralized security management.
